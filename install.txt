Building the Example

1.You need a NodeJS development stack with npm and grunt installed to build the project.
To install all project dependencies execute

npm install

2.
Build the example using browserify via

grunt

You may also spawn a development setup by executing

grunt auto-build

Both tasks generate the distribution ready client-side modeler application into the dist folder.
Serve the application locally or via a web server (nginx, apache, embedded).
